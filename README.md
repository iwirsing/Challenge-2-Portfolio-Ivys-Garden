## <u>User Story</u>

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## <u>Acceptance Criteria</u>

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## <u>Code Features</u>
- Garden themed. The main content (developer, portfolio, contact) is on brick raised beds.
- Navigation is sticky on desktop mode so user always have access to the content.
- Navigation becomes static in 768px or less mode.
- A RETURN button is added to help the user go back to the top of page, only really effective in desktop mode. Can be improved.
- Content in the garden beds are flex mode (row) while the reduced screen changes flex-direction to column.
- Nav buttons, app icons and contact icons generate responses when hovered to improve user experience.
- Alt comments and in many elements.
